## Hi there, I'm Mehdi welcome to my profile.

* I am a Software Engineer, Living in London, and a **Huge** Rust and Go enthusiast.

* Mostly interested in projects involving (but not limited to) Compilers, Programming languages, Developer tools ...

* I want to contribute more to open source projects (other than the ones that I create), and upload more educational videos and live streams to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwcFY6unYaay2Z9SEWIWUVA) and hopefully [blog](https://chermehdi.com) more regularly.

* I am pationate about teaching people what I learned, So if you have a project involving teaching people new things, feel free to reach out.
